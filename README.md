# Data-Analysis-and-Data-science-Python-Projects

# ðŸ“ŠData Analysis Project using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization using four powerful Python libraries:

   1)Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

  2)NumPy for numerical computing

  3)Matplotlib for basic plotting

  4)Seaborn for advanced, aesthetically pleasing visualizations
#  Key Objectives:
   Load and explore a dataset using Pandas

   Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

   Use NumPy for numerical operations and statistical calculations

   Visualize data trends and distributions using Matplotlib and Seaborn

   Derive insights through data correlation and comparison

#  Libraries Used:
  import pandas as pd
  
  import numpy as np
  
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
  import seaborn as sns

#  Project Highlights:
  Handling missing data

  Grouping and aggregating data

  Creating line plots, bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps

  Statistical analysis (mean, median, correlation matrix)
